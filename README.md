# Python-Code-self-directed-learning

## Greetings to anyone who see this *coding project*.
##### This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of my highschool life.
##### Feel free to click the links below.

## Project Source Codes:
* [StepUp.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/StepUp.py)
  *This program shows Karel picking up the beeper at Street 1 Avenue 2,putting it onto Street 2 Avenue 4.
   Karel will be facing East at Street2 Avenue 5 at the end of this program.
* [PotholeFilling.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/PotholeFilling.py)
  *This program shows Karel filling 3 potholes. Learning the concept of decomposition through the process.
* [MoveToTheEnd.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/MoveToTheEnd.py )
  *This file shows how to use while loop to walk to the end of a certain row in Karel world.
* [InfiniteLoop.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/InfiniteLoop.py)
  *This file shows the idea of infinite loop, reminding one of the 3 bugs in usingwhile loop.
* [BeeperRow.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/BeeperRow.py)
  *This program makes Karel fill up Street 1 with beepers.
* [BeeperRowAdv.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/BeeperRowAdv.py)
  *This program makes Karel fill up Street 1 with some beepers already Existed.
*[Steeplechase.py](https://github.com/Joyce950207/Python-Code-self-directed-learning/blob/main/Steeplechase.py)
 *This program makes Karel crossing hurdles in a 12x12 world with a for loop.
